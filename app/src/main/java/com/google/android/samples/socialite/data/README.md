# Data Layer

This directory contains the data layer of the SociaLite application. This includes:

-   **Data Sources:** Implementations for accessing data from various sources, such as the Room database and potentially network APIs.
-   **Repositories:** Classes that abstract the data sources and provide a clean API for the UI and other parts of the application to access data.
-   **Data Logic:** Any business logic related to data fetching, processing, and manipulation.

This layer is responsible for providing the data required by the application while abstracting the underlying data sources.
