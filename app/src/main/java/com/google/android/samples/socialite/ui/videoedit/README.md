# Video Edit Module

This directory contains the code for the video editing screen of the SociaLite application. After capturing a video with the in-app camera, users can perform minor edits on this screen before sharing.

-   **Video Edit UI:** Jetpack Compose composables (e.g., `VideoEditScreen.kt`) for displaying the video player, a timeline or scrubber for seeking, and controls for basic editing operations like trimming or applying filters (if implemented).
-   **ViewModel Logic:** A ViewModel (e.g., `VideoEditViewModel`) to manage the state and logic for the video editing screen. This ViewModel holds the state of the video playback, the editing parameters, and handles user interactions with the editing controls.
-   **Video Processing:** Code for applying basic video editing operations. This might involve using Android's MediaCodec or MediaMuxer APIs, or potentially a library like Media3, to perform operations like trimming the video to a specific duration or applying visual effects.

This module demonstrates how to integrate video playback and basic editing capabilities within the application.
