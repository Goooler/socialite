# Camera Module

This directory contains the code responsible for the in-app camera feature of the SociaLite application. This includes:

-   **Camera UI:** Jetpack Compose composables for displaying the camera preview, controls, and handling user interactions.
-   **CameraX Integration:** Logic for integrating with the CameraX library to capture photos and videos.
-   **Permissions Handling:** Code for requesting and managing camera and storage permissions.
-   **File Management:** Handling the saving of captured photos and videos.

The main entry point for the camera feature is typically a composable function within this directory that is navigated to from the chat screen.
